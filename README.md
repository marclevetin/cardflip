# cardflip
This is a prototype for a component of my personal website. I was looking for an easy way for a visitor to learn more about the technology behind the projects I've worked on, get to a demo site, and see the code.

I also needed to work on my CSS (because don't we all?), and this project was a good opportunity to learn how to do some new things: experiment in CSS tranforms, overflow, and so on.  Special thanks, in particular to David DeSandro and his [Intro to CSS 3D transforms](https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/)
